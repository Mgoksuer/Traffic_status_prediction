# Traffic_status_preditcion

The Road Traffic Status Prediction project is focused on creating a machine learning model that can predict the traffic condition of a road at a specific time. By using features like vehicle count, weather conditions, and time of day, this project aims to provide an efficient way to manage traffic and improve transportation systems. With more people living in cities, traffic congestion is becoming a bigger issue, and having a reliable way to predict traffic can help drivers, city planners, and transportation agencies make better decisions.. 
Being able to predict whether a road will be congested, less congested, or clear is very important for reducing traffic problems, saving time, and improving the flow of vehicles. This model will classify traffic conditions into three categories: Congested, Less Congested, and Clear, based on the input features. This prediction can help drivers choose the best routes and avoid delays.
This project will compare several machine learning algorithms—Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to determine which method provides the most reliable predictions of road traffic status. Using evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Cross Validation, and Confusion Matrix, we will assess and analyze the effectiveness of each approach. This analysis will not only provide insights into the factors influencing traffic conditions but will also demonstrate the power of machine learning in making accurate and practical real-world traffic predictions.
